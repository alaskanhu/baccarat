Python experiment in Baccarat simulation

First time using Python, fun little project. It's only meant as a learning experience and experiment, nothing more.

To run 'python baccarat_test.py'

Current state:

- The script runs 1 million games. To change the number of games, see command line arguments.
- The simulator can now do two types of baccarat: "standard" and "EZ". See command line arguments how to enable.

Command line arguments:
-t or --type: standard (default) or EZ (not case-sensitive)
-g or --games: number of games (simulations) to run. 1M is default.
