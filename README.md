Python experiment in Baccarat simulation

First time using Python, fun little project. It's only meant as a learning experience and experiment, nothing more.

To run 'python baccarat_test.py'

Current state:

- The script runs 1 million games. To change the number of games, set the no_games variable to the desired amount.
- The game is set for "regular" Baccarat. My intention is to add EZ Baccarat because simply I like it.
- There are no command line parameters.
